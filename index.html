    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p class = "projects-para"> <b>Discrete Locomotion in Virtual Reality</b><br>
        &emsp; Worked on a research project during studying the effect of locomotion techniques in virtual reality first-person 
        shooter games. Making comparisons between continuous locomotion and discrete locomotion to see which method is not only preferred by the player but also easier to perform. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Cross-View Attention in Mammography</b><br>
        &emsp; Worked on a project recreating and extending the research done in cross-view mammography. Cross-view mammography is the topic of using all four views 
        in a mammography examination. Using Attention in deep learning between the four views to generate attention maps for the channel and the spatial dimension. 
        These attention maps aid in the final classification.
    <br><br>
    <b>Breast Cancer Classification with Deep Learning</b><br>
        &emsp;Implemented a deep neural network working off of VGGnet to classify breast tissue 
        images taken from CT scans as either cancerous or non-cancerous.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cancer Classification Network</b><br>
        &emsp;Designed a user friendly interface for medical professionals to assist in cancer diagnosis. This project centralized around the deep neural network 
        that is a modified AlexNet to work with DICOM images. The implementation of this network was done in JavaScript for a user friendly web based platform.
